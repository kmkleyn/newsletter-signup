# newsletter-signup
An app using Node.js and Express.js that allows the user to sign up to a MailChimp newsletter.

The app uses the MailChimp API to allow the user to sign up to the newsletter. If the signup is successful, the user will see a success page. If there is an error signing up, the user will be notified on screen.

The API key and List Number are hidden using a secrets.js module.
